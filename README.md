Usage
Register:
Navigate to /register/ to create a new account.

Login:
Log in at /login/.

Manage Tasks:
Once logged in, you will be redirected to the task list where you can:

Create new tasks by clicking "Create New Task".
Edit or update tasks using the Edit button.
Delete tasks using the Delete button.
Logout (the logout URL automatically redirects you to the login page).
Customization
CSS Styling:
Customize the appearance by editing the tasks/static/tasks/style.css file.

Templates:
Modify templates in the templates/ directory to change the UI and layout.

Troubleshooting
Logout Redirection:
Ensure your URL configuration for logout is set up to immediately redirect to the login page. For example, in todo_project/urls.py:
``path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(next_page='/login/'), name='logout'),``
Static Files:
Make sure your STATIC_URL is correctly set in settings.py and that your static files are located in the proper directories.
